# Practice Project for Data Pipelining

In this project, we will extract all pokemons from Gen 1. Then we will try and figure out how to get their types and predict what they are strong/weak against.

## PART I:
##### reading from API and save the data into files and into database.
Use: <br>
https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#games-section
<br>
This Documentation will show you how to hit the API points and grab information on all the pokemons in GEN 1.
1. Find all pokemons exist in generation 1. Make sure you ignore other data besides pokemon_entries.
2. Use the data you have pulled and find the information on each Pokemon.
3. Once you have a final table, save it to SQL lite for future querying.
